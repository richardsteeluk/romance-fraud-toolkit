                    <p class="lead">Romance Fraud is the engineering of a supposed friendship or relationship for
                        fraudulent,
                        financial gain. Suspects invest significant amounts of time into socially engineering their
                        victims – knowing that as they gain the victim's trust, their chances of extracting considerable
                        funds from them simultaneously increase.</p>

            <h2>Family and Friends</h2>

            <p>
                It can be very difficult and frustrating watching someone close to you being scammed and
                manipulated, especially if you can see what is happening but they seem not to be able -or
                willing- to.
            </p>

            <p>You may have suffered your own losses from this fraud. You may feel you have lost a
                valuable relationship with your family member or friend. And you may have lost financially,
                for example if the victim borrowed money from you to pay the fraudster, or if the fraud has
                affected your inheritance.</p>

            <p>
                All of this makes it hard to help your friend or family member to free themselves and recover
                from romance fraud. Here we share some do’s and don’ts to help you support that person:
            </p>

            <p><b>DO</b></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Remember that, for victims of romance fraud, the romantic relationship is real. Being
                    in love with their abuser can make it hard for them to accept practical advice or ‘read’
                    the warning signs in the same way as people looking in from the outside</li>
                <li>Try to understand what they are going through. Romance fraud causes multiple kinds
                    of harm. These include relationship loss, financial loss and emotional and sexual
                    abuse. Victims can be left broke, broken-hearted, isolated from and abandoned by
                    family and friends, and seriously traumatised. They often suffer deep shame about
                    their abuse, as well as emotional devastation</li>
                <li>Learn about the recovery process for victims of romance fraud. This will put you in a
                    stronger position to help your family or friend to build trust and faith in themselves
                    and regain hope. Recovery is essential for building a person’s resilience against re-
                    victimisation. Many victims are victims more than once</li>
                <li>Help victims re-connect with friends and organisations they’ve been isolated from.
                    Romance fraudsters often monopolise and control their victims so their life and
                    identity centre around the fraudster. Inviting victims to participate in small, gentle
                    social outings can help them recover their sense of self as separate from their
                    abuser.</li>
                <li>Help victims stay safe by checking their risk levels. Have they had physical contact
                    with the fraudster? Have they shared their address, date of birth or card or bank
                    details? If so, they may need X, Y Z.</li>
                <li>Help victims to deal with the practical aspects of sorting out their lives. Victims often
                    need to gather evidence alone and deal with police, banks, insurers and other
                    organisations to try to mitigate the financial damage and get justice. This can be tiring
                    and confusing, and especially difficult for people who are also experiencing
                    psychological and emotional fallout.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>DON'T</b></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Judge, blame or shame victims for what has happened to them. Victims of romance
                    fraud did not do this to themselves. They have been skilfully groomed and
                    manipulated, often by people who are seasoned experts in this kind of crime.
                    Blaming and shaming victims can further isolate them and reduce their self-worth.
                    This harms their chances of becoming empowered to end the abuse, recover and
                    protect themselves in the future. Some victims have reported feeling suicidal and
                    some have ended their lives.</li>
                <li>Fixate on getting your friend or family member to ‘snap out of it’ or to see the
                    relationship as fake and fraudulent. Perspective and clarity will likely be achieved
                    once a victim has started their recovery. In the meantime, helping them to stay safe,
                    re-connect with others, and stop losing money should be your priority.</li>
                <li>Assume that the fact that someone has been victimised once means they are safe
                    from being victimised again in the future. Scammers often share contact details and
                    detailed and intimate personal information about people they have already victimised.
                    This inside information helps them target the same victim again, but this time even
                    more effectively</li>
            </ul>

            <p>"I was talking to one friend and she, instead of supports me, she judges me. ..that's not
                nice… it's the worst. So, I'd rather keep to myself now because I know how to deal, to dealt with
                it. Because it's painful the way I went. I had enough to go through and the last thing you need
                [is] to be judged."</p>

                <h2>Family and Friends</h2>

                <p><b>DO</b></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Inform yourself about the dynamics of romance fraud and the methods used by
                        fraudsters. Understanding how this kind of abuse works and what the psychological,
                        emotional, and financial impacts are will help you relate to, connect with, and better
                        support victims</li>
                    <li>Adopt a realistic definition of ‘success’ for engagement with a victim. The priority
                        should be to help people stay safe, re-connect with others outside the relationship to
                        reduce isolation, and stop sending money.</li>
                    <li>Accept that victims may continue to be in denial even when they need support. It is
                        unrealistic and unhelpful to expect a victim to just ‘snap out of it’. Interventions and
                        support will be more likely to succeed if based on an acknowledgement that there
                        may be a transitional period where a victim remains in contact with the fraudster</li>
                    <li>Follow up with victims if you are dealing with their case, even if it is just to tell them
                        that there is no progress, or that you have done all you can.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><b>DON'T</b></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Blame or shame victims for what has happened to them. Victims of romance fraud
                        did not do this to themselves. They have been skilfully groomed and manipulated,
                        often by seasoned criminals. Throwaway comments that imply victims are

                        Section 1
                        responsible for what happened to them can further isolate them and reduce their self-
                        worth. This harms their chances of becoming empowered to end the abuse, recover
                        and protect themselves in the future. Some victims have reported feeling suicidal and
                        some have ended their lives</li>
                    <li>Assume that victims know anything about how to protect themselves and their
                        finances. They likely won’t. Give victims all the information they might need and
                        signpost them to where they can report the fraud, get legal, financial, emotional or
                        psychological support, and protect themselves. For example, police are focused on
                        criminal cases, but some victims may want to pursue civil cases against their abuser.
                        Victims should be informed of their options.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>"When I spoke to [a victim support worker] and you know, she, she was, she
                    was an absolute godsend for me at that point, because I needed to hear from
                    somebody that I wasn't stupid. I wasn't, you know, this pathetic woman. You know
                    that, that he was a professional...a fraudster. That was the turning point for me.”</p>

            <h2>How can I get Help and Recover from Online Romance Fraud?</h1>

                <p>The trauma of experiencing ORF can make it feel difficult to reach out for help and support.
                    It can feel and be a very isolating experience when you are dealing with painful emotions, the
                    shock of the relationship and real losses in your life. It may feel impossible to share these
                    experiences with others in your life. You are not alone in going through such a painful
                    experience, as this can happen to anyone, of any age. There are important steps in beginning
                    to regain a sense of control, safety and healing from the effects on you and your life, both
                    now and in the future</p>

                <h2>Safety Matters</h2>

                <p>
                    Securing your own personal safety and accessing the right help is vital to begin stabilising the
                    situation. The checklist here is a guide to steps to take to secure your immediate and long-term
                    safety.
                </p>

                <h2>You are Important</h2>

                <p>
                    The idea of self-care may feel impossible when you have been so invalidated by another
                    person. You may have internalised feelings of worthlessness and shame, perhaps feeling
                    anxious and lost, confused without that relationship or not sure how to manage leaving the
                    relationship behind for your own wellbeing and protection. A sense of disbelief is another
                    natural reaction, and it can take time to adjust to the new reality you are experiencing and
                    how to address the situation for your present and future wellbeing.
                </p>

                <h2>Your Emotions Matter</h2>

                <p>Grief, anxiety and shame are recognised effects of the impact of a romance fraud relationship.
                    You may experience anger and outrage and powerless in achieving any sense of justice and
                    resolution for yourself in the wake of these experiences. Victims can be made to feel that the
                    relationship and what happens is their sole responsibly, and then feel ashamed that they
                    “didn’t see it coming” or “see through the person” and blame themselves. The grief of the
                    hopes of what has been lost and what has been lost is real, and emotional support is vital to
                    help prevent a downwards spiral of self-blame, guilt and self-rejection.</p>

                <h2>Acknowledge the hurt</h2>

                <p>This relationship has been real and meaningful until the realisation that the other person was
                    not who you believed them to be. Emotions and thoughts can feel conflicted, even though
                    they have been shown to have violated your trust you may miss the connection, intimacy and
                    hopes you had of the relationship. Trusting another person who then violates and betrays that
                    trust can result in deep hurt, loss of trust in yourself and others and have widespread effects in
                    life.
                    It is natural to avoid, maybe try to push away such painful and difficult responses to hurt.
                    Beginning to acknowledge how you feel and how this affects you is important is a first step
                    towards valuing yourself again and rebuilding your life. This understanding becomes a
                    valuable resource in protecting and regaining trust in yourself in your present and future life.</p>

                <h2>Self-kindness</h2>

                <p>A key point is reminding yourself, and be reminded by understanding others, that you are not
                    to blame for trusting another person who deliberately set out to deceive you. This is important
                    when you begin to think and feel painful thoughts, emotions and bodily sensations.
                    It may be hard to believe if others are blaming you for difficult consequences of this
                    experience in your life. Remember that fraudsters are adept at instilling self-doubt and
                    cultivating a false sense of security, trust and exploiting a willingness to help others in their
                    victims. They appeal to a natural human need to feel valued, loved and cared for. It may be
                    that you met them at a particularly difficult time in your life.
                    Paying attention to your physical and mental health is very important as you negotiate such a
                    painful experience. Grief and loss can have mental and physical health impacts. Some people
                    may have ptsd symptoms associated with trauma from the shock of what is or has happened
                    to them. As we have acknowledged, feelings and thoughts about yourself may make reaching
                    out for help difficult. We strongly encourage you to reach out for help with your health and
                    wellbeing at such as sensitive and challenging time. Professional and peer supporters are
                    trained in understanding the difficulties you may be facing and are committed to help you in
                    a constructive and meaningful way.</p>

                <h2>Healing and recovery are individual experiences</h2>

                <p>In any relationship, an identity forms from the people involved that is unique. Separating out
                    as an individual from this can both feel and be difficult. You may have had your confidence,
                    trust in yourself and your own judgement affected badly. This is a known effect of abusive
                    relationships and grooming strategies. When this happens, it becomes much harder to
                    experience and trust yourself as a separate person, with the confidence and ability to act on
                    your own behalf. You may feel disorientated, confused and conflicted about your own
                    identity, as you leave behind the identity you experienced in the relationship. Often, this is
                    not a cut and dried process, there can be so many areas of life to recover alongside navigating
                    the personal impacts of the experience.</p>

                <h2>Sharing your story</h2>

                <p>You may find recording your thoughts, and feelings through is helpful.
                    Over time, self-trust and confidence may grow as you experience healthier responses to your
                    emotional, mental and physical needs and desires in life.
                    Think about regular activities that help you feel calmer, share your life with others or gain
                    valuable restorative time by yourself.
                    Accessing one time and ongoing support may be important. Some people find joining peer
                    support groups helpful, as getting to know others with similar experiences can provide a
                    place where acceptance is an important value and others can help with strategies to cope with
                    the multiple effects of online romance fraud.
                    Counselling and therapy may also be powerful with a non-judgemental, skilled therapist who
                    provides a safe and confidential space to work through your concerns and what is best for
                    you in the future.

                    Learning coping strategies for the future.
                    Healing and recovery with hurtful and life changing experiences is an individual and unique
                    process. Learning about your own needs and vulnerabilities can increase your self-respect
                    and ability to protect yourself in future life.
