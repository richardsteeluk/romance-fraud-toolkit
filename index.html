                            it?</b></h2>
                    <div class="pullout-text">
                        <p class="lead">Romance Fraud is the engineering of a supposed friendship or relationship for
                            fraudulent,
                            financial gain. Suspects invest significant amounts of time into socially engineering their
                            victims – knowing that as they gain the victim's trust, their chances of extracting
                            considerable
                            funds from them simultaneously increase.</p>
                        <p class="lead">Fraudsters seek access to people online with the pretence of seeking a
                            relationship.
                            Romance frauds are typically a long-term scheme. This is because they rely on the
                            development of trust over time in order to exploit their target.
                            Over time, they use online grooming techniques to undermine the victim’s sense of
                            disbelief. In order to do this, the fraudster needs to present themselves as a viable
                            romantic
                            prospect who seeks a genuine relationship. They find out what the victim is looking for in a
                            relationship and then present themselves as the embodiment of that.</p>
                        <p class="lead">For a successful romance fraud to be complete, the fraudster needs to create the
                            appearance of a romantic prospect with whom a genuine, meaningful relationship is
                            developing and surreptitiously segue into types of talk likely to be at odds with this
                            romantic
                            scenario. Requests for money are the sole, yet hidden, function of an interaction where
                            romance is collectively the façade of, rationale for and the conduit through which the fraud
                            is performed and need careful management as monetary demands are likely to cause alarm.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="lead">Typically, the signs can manifest as:</p>
                    <ul>

                            Maria moved back to the UK after a number of years living abroad. Her marriage had ended
                            and she had elderly parents back home who needed care and support. After a couple of very
                            busy years working and caring for her parents, a friend suggested that it was time she do
                            something for herself and try online dating. She went on a few dates but didn’t find anyone
                            whom she clicked with. Then she matched with a guy online, John. He seemed perfect for her.
                            Maria is a very friendly chatty person and she wanted to meet someone similar. John was
                            charming in their chats. She also loved children and John was a widower with a teenage
                            daughter. He looked handsome in his profile photo.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            John told her that he was a builder and lived nearby but that he had to go to Africa to help
                            build
                            a school. He reassured her that they would meet in person when he got back. Their online
                            conversations continued. Whenever they spoke online, he would say that his computer camera
                            was broken. Then he told her that he was unable to get back to the UK just yet because his
                            employer hadn’t released his salary. Soon after that, he mentioned that his daughter’s
                            birthday
                            was coming up but he couldn’t buy her anything because of the situation with his salary. He
                            had told Maria that his daughter loved music. Maria also loved music. So then she offered to
                            buy an ipod for his daughter. She had it engraved on the back and sent to Africa. After
                            that,
                            requests for money started coming in. He would say things like ‘I can’t come home yet but if
                            you could send me £100 I could pay this person off’. Each time he asked for money, the
                            amount
                            increased.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            At one point, Maria got a bit suspicious. She asked to speak to his daughter and a young
                            girl
                            came on the phone, and they chatted for a while. John told her that he was flying back to
                            the
                            UK on Valentine’s Day. Maria took the day off work to meet him at the airport, but he didn’t
                            show. He said he had been too embarrassed to explain to her that he still couldn’t afford
                            to.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Around this time, a friend told Maria that she had seen a programme on tv about online
                            romance
                            fraud and that she thought this guy might not be real. Maria was very offended. She felt
                            that
                            she was a woman of the world who had lived abroad and wouldn’t be deceived in this way. But
                            she decided to ask John to send her a copy of his passport, so that she could prove he was
                            real.
                            Eventually, he sent a passport photo that showed the man whose photo she had seen online.
                            But the name at the bottom of the photo was different to the one that was shown elsewhere on
                            the passport page. She realised that she was a victim of online romance fraud.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Accepting that she had been victimise was difficult for Maria. She had invested a lot of
                            time
                            and energy in this relationship. Her conversations with John had become a part of her daily
                            life. She had also shared intimate photos with him. Knowing that he was not the person she
                            thought he was made her feel humiliated and embarrassed.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            When Maria looked back at the relationship, she recognised that she was very vulnerable at
                            the
                            time she met John. She had just gone through a difficult divorce and had taken on
                            significant
                            care responsibilities for her parents. She needed someone who was invested in her at that
                            point
                            in her life. The experience of online romance fraud left her feeling suicidal. She says that
                            the
                            only thing that stopped her from harming herself was her care responsibilities for her
                            parents.
                            2
                            Eventually, she confided in her mother and her best friend. Luckily, they were both kind and
                            understanding. She felt that they didn’t judge her and this was an important part of her
                            healing
                            process.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Over time, Maria recovered her self-confidence and self-belief. Making time for physical
                            fitness, which was a passion of hers, helped with this, as did the loving support of her
                            mother
                            and her best friend. After a few years, she met the man who is now her husband, via another
                            dating app. But this time around, if someone didn’t agree to meet in person quickly, she
                            stopped
                            corresponding with them. She knew not to provide any money to anyone. When she confided
                            in her husband about her experience of online romance fraud, he was kind and understanding.
                            She realised that the experience had left her with trust issues. But over time she was able
                            to
                            have a supportive and loving relationship again.

                            Jennifer was 27 and her six year relationship ended just before the pandemic began. She had
                            to
                            move out of the home she shared with her ex-partner and move in with her mother, stepfather
                            and younger brother. This was difficult and she argued with her stepfather a lot. She
                            managed
                            to get a small flat for herself. But then her mother’s marriage ended after her stepfather
                            was
                            abusive and violent, and her mother and brother moved in with her. Now, Jennifer and her
                            family were living in a small two bedroom flat and her mother and brother were also arguing
                            frequently. Jennifer felt very low and stressed about the end of her long-term relationship
                            and
                            her family situation.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Eventually Jennifer decided to try dating again and joined a dating app. She met a guy
                            called
                            James who was very chatty and friendly. Many of the messages she got from other guys on the
                            app quickly became very sexualised, but James was very respectful. His gentlemanly behaviour
                            captured her interest. They soon switched from chatting on the dating app to WhatsApp. She
                            looked forward to hearing from him and felt excited whenever he messaged her. James soon
                            told her about a site where you could invest cryptocurrency and make money on it. When he
                            first sent her screenshots of the site, she was very suspicious. But he kept on bringing it
                            up. She
                            gradually started to trust him more as they continued chatting online. He often complimented
                            her and made her feel good about herself. When he started sharing screenshots of his
                            investments increasing, she decided to invest £500. Soon she saw the amount go up. Then, as
                            a precaution she withdrew her investment, plus the profit, from the account. This happened
                            without any problem. That’s when she really believed that this was a genuine investment with
                            a high return rate. She soon reinvested this money back into the scheme. James also promised
                            that he would meet up with her in person soon.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Jennifer quickly began investing more and more money. But when she tried to withdraw her
                            money a second time, she was told that she needed to pay tax first. She told James that she
                            was
                            out of money and he suddenly disappeared, ghosting her completely. Then she started
                            receiving
                            threatening letters from the site saying that they would sue her if she didn’t pay the tax.
                            She
                            started to feel really scared and anxious, so she confided in a friend who was an
                            accountant.
                            He explained that this was a scam. She reported the experience to the police. Her family
                            were
                            supportive and understanding when she confided in them, but one friend was very judgmental
                            and made her feel worse. She hasn’t told anyone else and worries that people would judge her
                            if they knew.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The experience made Jennifer a lot more guarded about trusting people. However in time, she
                            began dating again and met her current partner via another dating app. She only corresponded
                            with people who agreed to meet quickly. Finding videos of people on social media who shared
                            her experience made her feel less alone and helped her realise that online romance fraud is
                            something that happens to many people.

                            Richard was in his seventies and had been widowed a few years earlier after a long and happy
                            marriage. During the pandemic, he decided to sign up to a dating app. He got chatting to a
                            woman, Heather, who said that she was a hairdresser. They developed a romantic relationship
                            online, which was a positive source of connection in his life during the pandemic. Heather
                            sent
                            him lots of photos of herself. She soon confided that she was having some financial
                            problems.
                            Then she said that she needed someone to redecorate her salon. Richard paid for the cost of
                            this, which was several hundred pounds. Heather convinced him that he was becoming a part
                            owner of the hair salon. Richard was also in contact with someone whom Heather presented as
                            her solicitor, which helped convince him that this was all above board. In fact, the
                            ‘solicitor’
                            was part of the scam.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Over time, Heather’s demands escalated and eventually he paid out over eighty thousand
                            pounds, all of which he thought was being invested directly into Heather’s business.
                            Eventually, she told him that her solicitor had run off with the money and that she needed
                            more
                            money to hire another solicitor to find him. Richard began to feel that something wasn’t
                            right
                            because she always had an excuse for not meeting in person. He approached his financial
                            advisor, who immediately suspected online romance fraud. When Richard confronted Heather,
                            she sent very angry and abusive messages.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Although Richard’s financial advisor and staff at the bank were very sympathetic, he
                            experienced some ridicule and disrespect from neighbours who found out about his situation.
                            This was difficult for him but he found comfort from friends who were supportive. Their
                            belief
                            in him made helped him to regain trust in people. He also felt that this was a situation
                            that many
                            people could find themselves in, given the right circumstances.

            <p class="mb-5">Romance Fraud is the creation of a supposed friendship or relationship to exploit somebody
                for financial gain. Typically, fraudsters seek access to people online with the pretence of
                seeking a relationship. Fraudsters invest significant amounts of time into manipulating their
                victims with the knowledge that as they gain their victim’s trust, the chances of getting money
                from them increases.</p>

                            Maria moved back to the UK after a number of years living abroad. Her marriage had ended
                            and she had elderly parents back home who needed care and support. After a couple of very
                            busy years working and caring for her parents, a friend suggested that it was time she do
                            something for herself and try online dating. She went on a few dates but didn’t find anyone
                            whom she clicked with. Then she matched with a guy online, John. He seemed perfect for her.
                            Maria is a very friendly chatty person and she wanted to meet someone similar. John was
                            charming in their chats. She also loved children and John was a widower with a teenage
                            daughter. He looked handsome in his profile photo.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            John told her that he was a builder and lived nearby but that he had to go to Africa to help
                            build
                            a school. He reassured her that they would meet in person when he got back. Their online
                            conversations continued. Whenever they spoke online, he would say that his computer camera
                            was broken. Then he told her that he was unable to get back to the UK just yet because his
                            employer hadn’t released his salary. Soon after that, he mentioned that his daughter’s
                            birthday
                            was coming up but he couldn’t buy her anything because of the situation with his salary. He
                            had told Maria that his daughter loved music. Maria also loved music. So then she offered to
                            buy an ipod for his daughter. She had it engraved on the back and sent to Africa. After
                            that,
                            requests for money started coming in. He would say things like ‘I can’t come home yet but if
                            you could send me £100 I could pay this person off’. Each time he asked for money, the
                            amount
                            increased.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            At one point, Maria got a bit suspicious. She asked to speak to his daughter and a young
                            girl
                            came on the phone, and they chatted for a while. John told her that he was flying back to
                            the
                            UK on Valentine’s Day. Maria took the day off work to meet him at the airport, but he didn’t
                            show. He said he had been too embarrassed to explain to her that he still couldn’t afford
                            to.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Around this time, a friend told Maria that she had seen a programme on tv about online
                            romance
                            fraud and that she thought this guy might not be real. Maria was very offended. She felt
                            that
                            she was a woman of the world who had lived abroad and wouldn’t be deceived in this way. But
                            she decided to ask John to send her a copy of his passport, so that she could prove he was
                            real.
                            Eventually, he sent a passport photo that showed the man whose photo she had seen online.
                            But the name at the bottom of the photo was different to the one that was shown elsewhere on
                            the passport page. She realised that she was a victim of online romance fraud.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Accepting that she had been victimise was difficult for Maria. She had invested a lot of
                            time
                            and energy in this relationship. Her conversations with John had become a part of her daily
                            life. She had also shared intimate photos with him. Knowing that he was not the person she
                            thought he was made her feel humiliated and embarrassed.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            When Maria looked back at the relationship, she recognised that she was very vulnerable at
                            the
                            time she met John. She had just gone through a difficult divorce and had taken on
                            significant
                            care responsibilities for her parents. She needed someone who was invested in her at that
                            point
                            in her life. The experience of online romance fraud left her feeling suicidal. She says that
                            the
                            only thing that stopped her from harming herself was her care responsibilities for her
                            parents.

                            Eventually, she confided in her mother and her best friend. Luckily, they were both kind and
                            understanding. She felt that they didn’t judge her and this was an important part of her
                            healing
                            process.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Over time, Maria recovered her self-confidence and self-belief. Making time for physical
                            fitness, which was a passion of hers, helped with this, as did the loving support of her
                            mother
                            and her best friend. After a few years, she met the man who is now her husband, via another
                            dating app. But this time around, if someone didn’t agree to meet in person quickly, she
                            stopped
                            corresponding with them. She knew not to provide any money to anyone. When she confided
                            in her husband about her experience of online romance fraud, he was kind and understanding.
                            She realised that the experience had left her with trust issues. But over time she was able
                            to
                            have a supportive and loving relationship again.

                            Jennifer was 27 and her six year relationship ended just before the pandemic began. She had
                            to
                            move out of the home she shared with her ex-partner and move in with her mother, stepfather
                            and younger brother. This was difficult and she argued with her stepfather a lot. She
                            managed
                            to get a small flat for herself. But then her mother’s marriage ended after her stepfather
                            was
                            abusive and violent, and her mother and brother moved in with her. Now, Jennifer and her
                            family were living in a small two bedroom flat and her mother and brother were also arguing
                            frequently. Jennifer felt very low and stressed about the end of her long-term relationship
                            and
                            her family situation.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Eventually Jennifer decided to try dating again and joined a dating app. She met a guy
                            called
                            James who was very chatty and friendly. Many of the messages she got from other guys on the
                            app quickly became very sexualised, but James was very respectful. His gentlemanly behaviour
                            captured her interest. They soon switched from chatting on the dating app to WhatsApp. She
                            looked forward to hearing from him and felt excited whenever he messaged her. James soon
                            told her about a site where you could invest cryptocurrency and make money on it. When he
                            first sent her screenshots of the site, she was very suspicious. But he kept on bringing it
                            up. She
                            gradually started to trust him more as they continued chatting online. He often complimented
                            her and made her feel good about herself. When he started sharing screenshots of his
                            investments increasing, she decided to invest £500. Soon she saw the amount go up. Then, as
                            a precaution she withdrew her investment, plus the profit, from the account. This happened
                            without any problem. That’s when she really believed that this was a genuine investment with
                            a high return rate. She soon reinvested this money back into the scheme. James also promised
                            that he would meet up with her in person soon.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Jennifer quickly began investing more and more money. But when she tried to withdraw her
                            money a second time, she was told that she needed to pay tax first. She told James that she
                            was
                            out of money and he suddenly disappeared, ghosting her completely. Then she started
                            receiving
                            threatening letters from the site saying that they would sue her if she didn’t pay the tax.
                            She
                            started to feel really scared and anxious, so she confided in a friend who was an
                            accountant.
                            He explained that this was a scam. She reported the experience to the police. Her family
                            were
                            supportive and understanding when she confided in them, but one friend was very judgmental
                            and made her feel worse. She hasn’t told anyone else and worries that people would judge her
                            if they knew.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The experience made Jennifer a lot more guarded about trusting people. However in time, she
                            began dating again and met her current partner via another dating app. She only corresponded
                            with people who agreed to meet quickly. Finding videos of people on social media who shared
                            her experience made her feel less alone and helped her realise that online romance fraud is
                            something that happens to many people.

                            Richard was in his seventies and had been widowed a few years earlier after a long and happy
                            marriage. During the pandemic, he decided to sign up to a dating app. He got chatting to a
                            woman, Heather, who said that she was a hairdresser. They developed a romantic relationship
                            online, which was a positive source of connection in his life during the pandemic. Heather
                            sent

                            problems.
                            Then she said that she needed someone to redecorate her salon. Richard paid for the cost of
                            this, which was several hundred pounds. Heather convinced him that he was becoming a part
                            owner of the hair salon. Richard was also in contact with someone whom Heather presented as
                            her solicitor, which helped convince him that this was all above board. In fact, the
                            ‘solicitor’
                            was part of the scam.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Over time, Heather’s demands escalated and eventually he paid out over eighty thousand
                            pounds, all of which he thought was being invested directly into Heather’s business.
                            Eventually, she told him that her solicitor had run off with the money and that she needed
                            more
                            money to hire another solicitor to find him. Richard began to feel that something wasn’t
                            right
                            because she always had an excuse for not meeting in person. He approached his financial
                            advisor, who immediately suspected online romance fraud. When Richard confronted Heather,
                            she sent very angry and abusive messages.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Although Richard’s financial advisor and staff at the bank were very sympathetic, he
                            experienced some ridicule and disrespect from neighbours who found out about his situation.
                            This was difficult for him but he found comfort from friends who were supportive. Their
                            belief
                            in him made helped him to regain trust in people. He also felt that this was a situation
                            that many
                            people could find themselves in, given the right circumstances.

            <h2><b>Family and Friends</b></h2>

            <p>
                It can be very difficult and frustrating watching someone close to you being scammed and
                manipulated, especially if you can see what is happening but they seem not to be able -or
                willing- to.
            </p>

            <p>You may have suffered your own losses from this fraud. You may feel you have lost a
                valuable relationship with your family member or friend. And you may have lost financially,
                for example if the victim borrowed money from you to pay the fraudster, or if the fraud has
                affected your inheritance.</p>

            <p>
                All of this makes it hard to help your friend or family member to free themselves and recover
                from romance fraud. Here we share some do’s and don’ts to help you support that person:
            </p>

            <h3>Do</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Remember that, for victims of romance fraud, the romantic relationship is real. Being
                    in love with their abuser can make it hard for them to accept practical advice or ‘read’
                    the warning signs in the same way as people looking in from the outside</li>
                <li>Try to understand what they are going through. Romance fraud causes multiple kinds
                    of harm. These include relationship loss, financial loss and emotional and sexual
                    abuse. Victims can be left broke, broken-hearted, isolated from and abandoned by
                    family and friends, and seriously traumatised. They often suffer deep shame about
                    their abuse, as well as emotional devastation</li>
                <li>Learn about the recovery process for victims of romance fraud. This will put you in a
                    stronger position to help your family or friend to build trust and faith in themselves
                    and regain hope. Recovery is essential for building a person’s resilience against re-
                    victimisation. Many victims are victims more than once</li>
                <li>Help victims re-connect with friends and organisations they’ve been isolated from.
                    Romance fraudsters often monopolise and control their victims so their life and
                    identity centre around the fraudster. Inviting victims to participate in small, gentle
                    social outings can help them recover their sense of self as separate from their
                    abuser.</li>
                <li>Help victims stay safe by checking their risk levels. Have they had physical contact
                    with the fraudster? Have they shared their address, date of birth or card or bank
                    details? If so, they may need X, Y Z.</li>
                <li>Help victims to deal with the practical aspects of sorting out their lives. Victims often
                    need to gather evidence alone and deal with police, banks, insurers and other
                    organisations to try to mitigate the financial damage and get justice. This can be tiring
                    and confusing, and especially difficult for people who are also experiencing
                    psychological and emotional fallout.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Don't</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Judge, blame or shame victims for what has happened to them. Victims of romance
                    fraud did not do this to themselves. They have been skilfully groomed and
                    manipulated, often by people who are seasoned experts in this kind of crime.
                    Blaming and shaming victims can further isolate them and reduce their self-worth.
                    This harms their chances of becoming empowered to end the abuse, recover and
                    protect themselves in the future. Some victims have reported feeling suicidal and
                    some have ended their lives.</li>
                <li>Fixate on getting your friend or family member to ‘snap out of it’ or to see the
                    relationship as fake and fraudulent. Perspective and clarity will likely be achieved
                    once a victim has started their recovery. In the meantime, helping them to stay safe,
                    re-connect with others, and stop losing money should be your priority.</li>
                <li>Assume that the fact that someone has been victimised once means they are safe
                    from being victimised again in the future. Scammers often share contact details and
                    detailed and intimate personal information about people they have already victimised.
                    This inside information helps them target the same victim again, but this time even
                    more effectively</li>
            </ul>

            <p><em><h4>"I was talking to one friend and she, instead of supports me, she judges me. ..that's not
                nice… it's the worst. So, I'd rather keep to myself now because I know how to deal, to dealt with
                it. Because it's painful the way I went. I had enough to go through and the last thing you need
                [is] to be judged."</h4></em></p>

            <h2><b>Professionals</b></h2>

            <h3>Do</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Inform yourself about the dynamics of romance fraud and the methods used by
                    fraudsters. Understanding how this kind of abuse works and what the psychological,
                    emotional, and financial impacts are will help you relate to, connect with, and better
                    support victims</li>
                <li>Adopt a realistic definition of ‘success’ for engagement with a victim. The priority
                    should be to help people stay safe, re-connect with others outside the relationship to
                    reduce isolation, and stop sending money.</li>
                <li>Accept that victims may continue to be in denial even when they need support. It is
                    unrealistic and unhelpful to expect a victim to just ‘snap out of it’. Interventions and
                    support will be more likely to succeed if based on an acknowledgement that there
                    may be a transitional period where a victim remains in contact with the fraudster</li>
                <li>Follow up with victims if you are dealing with their case, even if it is just to tell them
                    that there is no progress, or that you have done all you can.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Don't</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Blame or shame victims for what has happened to them. Victims of romance fraud
                    did not do this to themselves. They have been skilfully groomed and manipulated,
                    often by seasoned criminals. Throwaway comments that imply victims are
                    Commented [HD5]: Include hyperlink to resources in
                    Section 1
                    responsible for what happened to them can further isolate them and reduce their self-
                    worth. This harms their chances of becoming empowered to end the abuse, recover
                    and protect themselves in the future. Some victims have reported feeling suicidal and
                    some have ended their lives</li>

            </ul>


            <p><em><h4>Fraud Prevention Practitioner: "We need to try and understand it from the victims
            perspective so we may gently walk beside them back to reality"</h4></em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Assume that victims know anything about how to protect themselves and their
                    finances. They likely won’t. Give victims all the information they might need and
                    signpost them to where they can report the fraud, get legal, financial, emotional or
                    psychological support, and protect themselves. For example, police are focused on
                    criminal cases, but some victims may want to pursue civil cases against their abuser.
                    Victims should be informed of their options.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><em><h4>"When I spoke to [a victim support worker] and you know, she, she was, she
                was an absolute godsend for me at that point, because I needed to hear from
                somebody that I wasn't stupid. I wasn't, you know, this pathetic woman. You know
                that, that he was a professional...a fraudster. That was the turning point for me.”</h4></em></p>

            <p class="mb-5">The trauma of experiencing ORF can make it feel difficult to reach out for help and support.
                It can feel and be a very isolating experience when you are dealing with painful emotions, the
                shock of the relationship and real losses in your life. It may feel impossible to share these
                experiences with others in your life. You are not alone in going through such a painful
                experience, as this can happen to anyone, of any age. There are important steps in beginning
                to regain a sense of control, safety and healing from the effects on you and your life, both
                now and in the future.</p>

            <h3>Safety Matters</h3>

            <p>
                Securing your own personal safety and accessing the right help is vital to begin stabilising the
                situation. The guidance and resources in this site will support you with steps to take to secure your
                immediate and long-term safety.
            </p>

            <h3>You are Important</h3>

            <p>
                The idea of self-care may feel impossible when you have been so invalidated by another
                person. You may have internalised feelings of worthlessness and shame, perhaps feeling
                anxious and lost, confused without that relationship or not sure how to manage leaving the
                relationship behind for your own wellbeing and protection. A sense of disbelief is another
                natural reaction, and it can take time to adjust to the new reality you are experiencing and
                how to address the situation for your present and future wellbeing.
            </p>

            <h3>Your Emotions Matter</h3>

            <p>Grief, anxiety and shame are recognised effects of the impact of a romance fraud relationship.
                You may experience anger and outrage and powerless in achieving any sense of justice and
                resolution for yourself in the wake of these experiences. Victims can be made to feel that the
                relationship and what happens is their sole responsibly, and then feel ashamed that they
                “didn’t see it coming” or “see through the person” and blame themselves. The grief of the
                hopes of what has been lost and what has been lost is real, and emotional support is vital to
                help prevent a downwards spiral of self-blame, guilt and self-rejection.</p>

            <h3>Acknowledge the hurt</h3>

            <p>This relationship has been real and meaningful until the realisation that the other person was
                not who you believed them to be. Emotions and thoughts can feel conflicted, even though
                they have been shown to have violated your trust you may miss the connection, intimacy and
                hopes you had of the relationship. Trusting another person who then violates and betrays that
                trust can result in deep hurt, loss of trust in yourself and others and have widespread effects in
                life.
                It is natural to avoid, maybe try to push away such painful and difficult responses to hurt.
                Beginning to acknowledge how you feel and how this affects you is important is a first step
                towards valuing yourself again and rebuilding your life. This understanding becomes a
                valuable resource in protecting and regaining trust in yourself in your present and future life.</p>

            <h3>Self-kindness</h3>

            <p>A key point is reminding yourself, and be reminded by understanding others, that you are not
                to blame for trusting another person who deliberately set out to deceive you. This is important
                when you begin to think and feel painful thoughts, emotions and bodily sensations.
                It may be hard to believe if others are blaming you for difficult consequences of this
                experience in your life. Remember that fraudsters are adept at instilling self-doubt and
                cultivating a false sense of security, trust and exploiting a willingness to help others in their
                victims. They appeal to a natural human need to feel valued, loved and cared for. It may be
                that you met them at a particularly difficult time in your life.
                Paying attention to your physical and mental health is very important as you negotiate such a
                painful experience. Grief and loss can have mental and physical health impacts. Some people
                may have ptsd symptoms associated with trauma from the shock of what is or has happened
                to them. As we have acknowledged, feelings and thoughts about yourself may make reaching
                out for help difficult. We strongly encourage you to reach out for help with your health and
                wellbeing at such as sensitive and challenging time. Professional and peer supporters are
                trained in understanding the difficulties you may be facing and are committed to help you in
                a constructive and meaningful way.</p>

            <h3>Healing and recovery are individual experiences</h3>

            <p>In any relationship, an identity forms from the people involved that is unique. Separating out
                as an individual from this can both feel and be difficult. You may have had your confidence,
                trust in yourself and your own judgement affected badly. This is a known effect of abusive
                relationships and grooming strategies. When this happens, it becomes much harder to
                experience and trust yourself as a separate person, with the confidence and ability to act on
                your own behalf. You may feel disorientated, confused and conflicted about your own
                identity, as you leave behind the identity you experienced in the relationship. Often, this is
                not a cut and dried process, there can be so many areas of life to recover alongside navigating
                the personal impacts of the experience.</p>

            <h3>Sharing your story</h3>

            <p>You may find recording your thoughts, and feelings through is helpful.

                Think about regular activities that help you feel calmer, share your life with others or gain
                valuable restorative time by yourself.
                Accessing one time and ongoing support may be important. Some people find joining peer
                support groups helpful, as getting to know others with similar experiences can provide a
                place where acceptance is an important value and others can help with strategies to cope with
                the multiple effects of online romance fraud.

                Over time, self-trust and confidence may grow as you experience healthier responses to your
                emotional, mental and physical needs and desires in life.

                Counselling and therapy may also be powerful with a non-judgemental, skilled therapist who
                provides a safe and confidential space to work through your concerns and what is best for
                you in the future.

                Learning coping strategies for the future.
                Healing and recovery with hurtful and life changing experiences is an individual and unique
                process. Learning about your own needs and vulnerabilities can increase your self-respect
                and ability to protect yourself in future life.</p>
